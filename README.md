ShoppingCart_OpenEjb_Standalone
===============================
I have created a sample openejb standalone application. The motive behind the example is to contribute towards openejb examples. For that I need your feedback if its a recommended way of using openejb.
This application is a standalone Restful application developed using OpenEJB.

To run this application you need gradle in place.
In the command prompt enter
$gradle run


At the end you should see.
REST Application: http://0.0.0.0:8080/ShoppingCart
Please replace 0.0.0.0 with the host name of the server
